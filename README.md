# SquireBot

SquireBot is a bot for use in Discord chat rooms for rolling dice, and
eventually to help automate some tabletop-turned-text-based gaming systems. For
now, is based largely off of the tutorial listed at the following link:

https://boostlog.io/@junp1234/how-to-write-a-discord-bot-in-python-5a8e73aca7e5b7008ae1da8b

It also uses https://github.com/Isklar/DiceBot as inspiration for the rolling
commands, but cleans them up a bit.

As time goes on, I will remove more of the features specific to that example
and populate it with more purposeful examples. I take no credit for the contents
of that tutorial.
